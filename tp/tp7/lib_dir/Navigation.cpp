/**

 * @brief Implementation of the Navigation class methods.
 *
 * This file contains the implementation of the Navigation class methods, which control the movement of a robot.
 * The Navigation class uses two Wheel objects to control the speed and direction of the robot's movement.
 * The class provides methods to move the robot forward, backward, turn left or right, spin in place, and stop.
 * The class also includes a private method to validate the speed input to ensure it is within the acceptable range.
